**Morning**
 I was learning about array, strings and objects and its types so there are small diffrences in all the strings, objects and arrays.


**Anna session**
 We had anna session and he taught loop, so a loop is basically a repeat function that we use it as for, while and if conditions, and anna taught us the fundamendal things and how to write a syntax in loop, so that we get the idea of how to build a syntax for loop.And then we were asked to work in loops, so that we get clarity in loops, and we got doubts like how the argumenyts are used and does it needs a colen and semicolen, so working out is more important that just learning.

**Kowshik session**
 We had kowshik session and he taught function, how a function works, and how to use a function inside a function so that is what we learned today.How the control flow will go look a program, so first it will check the main program and then it goes to the call function, on the call function it goes to the referred function and then the operation happens.And then again the same opertion goes on until there is no call function left.


**Programming**
  So the fundamendals of developing programming language is finished and it is upto us to think, a problem and solution for it, so the logic comes with basics of problem solving. That is taught first, so that is what we need to develop our skills in. Coding, anyone can do, but the right solution and correct solution, not more not less is the skill we need to develop with practise.


**Task**
 My mentor gave me a task, i learnt the basics of html,css and javascript, now its time to leaarn angular so we were asked to learn angular and start to work in it. and as my mentor will be off from tomorrow. I asked for a mentor and then he said everyone is your mentor and that is something new. So i will be given task by all and i will have to ask everyone the doubts. Even though nobody is watching and nobody gives me work, i have to ask for work and finish the pending works.ofcourse i have lots of works to do,from project to compiler and the angular has been added to bucket list and also i need to work all the things ive learned, the functions,arrays and loop operations.
