**Design**
I worked in figma from morning in my leave portal design, i kind of got familiar with the figma like using drafts and rebuilding it. I worked in 3 models and not sure which page to have because i am not sure with the design.And then i started to makea design roughly in paper and it kind of went good, i wrote what are all the options im going to use and the things a portal needs, so there are quite a few requirements that a portal should have so that the portal will be user-friendly and will give user a good experience. So thatis what a portal needs. So im designing a page that its color reference is  from the company official site.


**Task** 
  My mentor gave me a task to learn about arrays, objects and strings. Where the array is common and how are all the arrays be used is what i learnt there were a lot of array, but i was asked to learn some specific arrays and still i wasnt asked to learn it completely but to know about all the arrays.Sothat whenever i use an array i should get an idea of what are the possiblities i can have is the main reason i was asked to know about those.So getting familiar was the only purpose of learning those arrays.

Then the object, i was asked to learn about that too and this too some of the most used objects of all. How to create, edit,update, delete a key value,and create a key value. These were the only objects to be known about for now.
And next is the string, and that too has some of more specific strings to be known about so i started learning, these are the basics for programming,and these are not needed to be thorough, but needed to be known.


**Kowshik session**	
  Kowshik taught us functions and dart. How exactly a funtion in dart works and how a function inside a function works, and also he showed the control flow diagram of how a machine scans the program.So it first looks the main and then it will come to call back function and then a execution stack is created so that the called function will be checked and the where it denotes, that operation will be done if not the operation is declared then it will throw an error saying that the function is not declared and then a execution stack is created so that the called function will be checked and the where it denotes, that operation will be done if not the operation is declared then it will throw an error saying that the function is not declared, and we need to work on these so that we get familiar with these.

 
**Suggestion meeting**
  We had suggestion meeting with abraham anna, and he wants us to work more.
