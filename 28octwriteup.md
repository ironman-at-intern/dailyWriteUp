**Breakfast**
   Ive never thought of bringing this up in write up, but it pained me after wasting the food. I usually skips the breakfast in the office when it is from fevilia, especially if its pongal and idli. As usually, one of the intern didnt have breakfast in the office and ate breakfast in the restaurant near the office. So after we had our breakfast i was walking to the office and saw a beggar begging with her child for alms, i first thought of giving the breakfast from the office to them and after i came to realise that we wasted a lot of food these days and they were begging for something we throw out in to dump. And i knew they would have gone from that place so i decided to eat it somehow and it is one good food, and before i eat it george ate it. And that is something ive regretted so much after days.

**Compiler**
   I was preparing my own language and that needs to be in a manner that the system understands it, so i was actually speaking to a machine in my own language by assigning the words.Ive created something using operators, variables,array,objects and for should be used, ive created the language but to interact with the machine i need to learn the machine language that is the syntax. All now is i need to learn the syntax and create a compiler.And for the first time ive asked my mentor a doubt and he has cleared it and i used to  ask everyone except him, i dont know why i always felt like i shall not disturb him, and from today i could disturb him for any doubts.


**Presentation** 
  I had my presentation today and how i did, that is still a question to me, but i should wait and explain and also in changing slides, and i was focused more in slides so that i left the main part that providing more clear information about the project, and i missed a slide too so they didnt get a clear picture of what i was trying to explain.
And i wasnt ashamed in all these comments, but after that my mentor started to clear all the doubts that i should have done to the teammates and it started to sweat and i felt so bad making him clear the doubts. That is the only reason ive accepted to present the product development again.



**Culture talks**
  Anna is the first person i have ever seen in my life with the quality that,like, what he told is what he is whatever be the things we ask him he is so clear with his office and thoughts. Ive learnt about who a friend is and what a man and women should be.I could write a lot but i need to do my homeworks exercies.
