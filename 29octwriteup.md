**Presentation**
  As my presentation was not clear with the flow in the last meeting, i did my presentation flow architechture and i prepared the flow chart and i was working for the meeting. I almost did my preparation and all set for the presentation. as it was friday and we used to have demo meet every week so we were about to present our project in the demo meeting.


**Abraham session:
 We had anna session on friday and anna came to office just for this session. And taught us functions and how an addition works, and we were asked to practise that operation and if we had any doubts in that we need to clarify it right after 30 mins which we should have, but after that session we had a confusion and we started to prepare for the demo work and so anna kind of got irritated and said we can have the session on monday. So he wanted us think so we will get some doubt, we were supposed to get some doubts it seemed and then we asked the same return command again.And for the past week we will be learning about Scope and need to work in that too, that will be taken by kowshik.

**Demo Meet**
  We had a demo meet which we didnt present on friday but still, i was preparing for the presentation, which i should have presented the flow architecture of my project, But as the cab came soon and time was not there to present i didnt finish my presentation.
