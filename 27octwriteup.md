#SYNOPSIS
  Compiler
  Anna session
  Presentation



**Compiler**
Today i learned about compiler, how a compiler works and i was asked to develop my own language compiler. I tried and i didnt check the outcome well all with the objects ive worked in the terminal at first, and then i started in console from inspect as element. Then i worked in that, i assigned let and identifier and object, so what defines an object is the curly bracket but not the let or const. Ebin taught the basics of how to make a compiler using a and b


**Abraham session**
 ###object
  we had a 30 mins session with anna kind of effective methord, he taught about object and arrays today.the commands let and constant can be used can be used first and open a curly bracket then close a curly bracket that all the characters inside these are the objects.If we need to call a element inside the object section.The key is the first things inside object and values are the arithmetic operator, they both are properties. To access the properties in objects dot will be used to call the key and value,and it can be edited and deleted and replaced by using the dot parameter.


###array 
  We learned about array, arrays are characters and integers that comes inside the square brackets and it too can be used to delete edit update elements in the array.


I have to concentrate more in extreme ownership that any other books, because we need to write a summary about that book and i was learning and started to write the daily write up in markdown language and using primitives i was asked to create a statement.


###Presentation
